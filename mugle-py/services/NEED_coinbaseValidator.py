# Check against the wallet that a coinbase payout was made for each pool_block.
# We need to know the actual reward amount including fees.  Add the actual amount
# to the pool_blocks table so it can be used to calculate payout.
#
# If there is no record of the block reward in the wallet, invalidate the pool_block
