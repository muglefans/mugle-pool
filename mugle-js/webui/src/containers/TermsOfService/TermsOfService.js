                <ol>
                  <li>You may only apply to register as a Participant if:</li>
                  <li>you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into this Agreement and to abide by all of the terms
                    and conditions set forth herein;</li>
                  <li>you are of the age of majority in the applicable jurisdiction; and</li>
                  <li>To register as a Participant, you must create an Account using MuglePool&apos;s login / registration page.</li>
                  <li>Your username and password will be allocated to you if you successfully apply for registration as a
                    Participant. You will need your username and password to access the Service. In particular, your username and
                    password are personal to you and must not be disclosed to any other person. Note that MuglePool admin will
                    never ask you to disclose your password. Any message the Participant receives or website that he/she visits
                    that asks for the password, other than the Website, should be reported to MuglePool. The Participant is
                    responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of his/her Account’s credentials, including, but not limited
                    to, username, password, Wallet address, and all activity made through the Account.</li>
                  <li>You will need to enter at least one Wallet address in order to receive automated Payouts.</li>
                  <li>Each Participant is limited to one Account.</li>
                  <li>By submitting the registration application, the Participant confirms that they are not acting for the
                    benefit of any other person or entity not identified on such application.</li>
                  <li>If you lose access to your Account, MuglePool may ask you to provide certain types of data, including
                    mining statistical data and / or recent payout amounts.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>F. Pool Fee</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>We provide the platform on which the Mining Pool operates, in return for which we charge a Pool Fee to each
                    Participant, which includes maintenance and electricity costs and other expenditures required to render the
                    Service. The Pool Fee is applied to each Payout and is non-refundable.</li>
                  <li>Participant acknowledges and agrees that (a) MuglePool must receive the payment of each Pool Fee in order for
                    MuglePool to continue to operate the Platform, (b) given that the Pool Fee is calculated as a percentage of the
                    Gross Payout, should the value of the Gross Payouts decline (including due to factors such as currency
                    fluctuation and increased regulation), the total Gross Payouts of all of the participants may be insufficient
                    to generate the necessary Pool Fees, and (c) in that case, MuglePool may terminate this Agreement upon prior
                    written notice to the Participant.</li>
                  <li>MuglePool may, from time to time, upon notice waive the Pool Fee for promotional and marketing purposes, in
                    which case the Payout shall be equal to the Gross Payout during the period of such waiver.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>G. Risk Notice</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Actions with Cryptocurrencies carry inherent risks. Cryptocurrencies may not be appropriate for everyone.
                    By applying to be a Participant, you confirm that you have learned about Cryptocurrencies to ensure that they
                    are appropriate for you, and accept the risks.</li>
                  <li>Like all currencies, there are disadvantages to using Cryptocurrencies. Some of the risks particular to Cryptocurrencies include:<ol>
                    <li>currency fluctuation &#8211; the price of MUGLE may fall sharply and may even fall to zero;</li>
                  </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>transactions with Cryptocurrencies may be unconfirmed for a period of time. Although very unlikely, some
                    MUGLE transactions may never be confirmed &#8211; MUGLE transactions which are unconfirmed
                    are not completed;</li>
                  <li>transactions with Cryptocurrencies are irreversible &#8211; if you send any amount of any MUGLE to
                    the wrong person, you may be unable to recover those funds;</li>
                  <li>Cryptocurrencies may be lost if you lose or forget any PINs or passwords necessary to access and spend
                    those Cryptocurrencies;</li>
                  <li>unknown technical defects inherent in Cryptocurrencies; and</li>
                  <li>new regulation which impacts the use of Cryptocurrencies.</li>
                  <li>You must not mine, buy, sell, exchange, hold, own or otherwise use or exploit Cryptocurrencies in any way
                    which is prohibited by the laws or regulations which apply to you.</li>
                  <li>Due to the fact that Cryptocurrencies are unregulated and decentralized, their value is not insured by any
                    legal entities. The value of any amount of any MUGLE is subject to change by MuglePool due to a number
                    of factors out of the control of MuglePool. These factors include but are not limited to changes of mining
                    difficulty and/or other mining parameters/properties, fluctuating price (in fiat currency to MUGLE
                    exchange rate, such as USD/MUGLE) of Cryptocurrencies. You understand and agree that the value of any Payout,
                    and any amount of mined MUGLE, may lose all value at any moment of time due to the nature of
                    Cryptocurrencies.</li>
                  <li>You understand that you are solely responsible for management of the Cryptocurrencies in your Wallet.</li>
                  <li>Any information related to MUGLE and MUGLE mining that is/was posted, published and/or
                    provided by MuglePool via any channel of communication (including but not limited to: on the Website, in via
                    email newsletter, in social media) is informational only and is subject to change.</li>
                  <li>There is risk associated with hacking the Service, including denial of services attacks, malware attacks,
                    mining attacks or consensus-based attacks.</li>
                  <li>There are risks associated with usage of the Service through internet including the failure of hardware,
                    software, configuration and internet connections. Without limitation MuglePool will not be responsible for any
                    configuration, connection or communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays Participant
                    may experience when using MuglePool Service, howsoever caused.</li>
                  <li>IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR US TO STATE DEFINITIVELY HOW MANY MUGLE UNITS, IF ANY, WILL BE MINED DURING
                    ANY PAYOUT PERIOD.</li>
                  <li>Participant acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing is informational only and is not an exhaustive list
                    of all risks – in addition to the risks disclosed above, there are risks that MuglePool cannot foresee.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>H. Term and Termination</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Each Participant may terminate the Agreement, and close their Account at any time, following settlement of
                    any pending transactions.</li>
                  <li>Each Participant also agrees that MuglePool may, by giving notice, at its sole discretion terminate their
                    access to the Service and to their Account, delay or remove hosted content, and take technical and legal
                    steps to terminate the Participant’s use of the Service if the Participant is in breach of the Agreement.</li>
                  <li>MuglePool may, by giving notice, at its sole discretion terminate access to the Service for more than one or
                    all participants</li>
                  <li>Accounts which are inactive for longer than twelve (12) months (no mining activity) may be deleted after
                    three email warnings. Remaining Payout or shares associated with the Account will be considered as a donation
                    to the Mining Pool with no further attribution or obligation to Participant.</li>
                  <li>Upon termination, the Participant Account will be closed, and access to the Service revoked, and any Payout
                    accrued by the effective date of such termination paid into the Wallet of the Participant.</li>
                  <li>Without limiting any other rights we have, we may suspend access to your Account, and the Service, if you
                    breach this Agreement, or if we have grounds to suspect that you are using the Service fraudulently or
                    improperly until you are able to demonstrate to our satisfaction your identity and that no fraud or
                    impropriety has occurred or been attempted.</li>
                  <li>If you become aware of or suspect another person’s breach of this Agreement or any fraud or impropriety in
                    connection with the Service, you must contact us immediately.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>I. Use of Your Account</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>You may only participate in the Mining Pool for your own benefit. By using the Service you confirm that you

                    ACCOUNT. WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY IMPROPER USE OF YOUR USERNAME, PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT BY YOU OR ANY OTHER
                    PERSON. IF YOU HAVE REASONS TO ASSUME THAT ANY OTHER PERSON KNOWS YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD, OR THAT YOUR
                    ACCOUNT HAS BEEN USED BY ANY OTHER PERSON, YOU MUST INFORM US IMMEDIATELY.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>J. Payout</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>In consideration for the Contribution, MuglePool shall pay Participant a Payout in accordance with the Payout
